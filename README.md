# Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of Personal projects in Web Scraping, Data Analysis, Image Processing and Machine Learning. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks. 
## Webscraping projects
  1. https://github.com/DibyaSadhukhan/Portfolio/tree/main/main/Webscraping/Moneycontrol 
     Scrapes the daily data of FII and DII sales/purchases and writes them to a csv file.
## Projects Currently Deployed
<ul>
<li>Laptop reveiws: http://laptopreviews2021.herokuapp.com/ :</li>
	A website that scrapes all the details and reviews of laptops currently in stock on amazon. The reviews are then analyzed and visualized for the            better and easier understanding of the user.
      	Implemented a filter system that filters and displays the laptops available in the database and best matches the userâ€™s query. 
      	Using NLP, highlights the accent words in the reviews and gives a comprehensive report about that laptop.
	Technologies:	HTML CSS,NLP,Javascript, Python, Django, Data Mining
<li>Anime Recommender	Link:http://animerecommender2022.herokuapp.com/:</li> 
	Designed a website to accept a query from the user and give them an anime recommendation from over 12000 anime. 
	The recommender uses a Machine Learning algorithm  to give the user a list of recommended anime based on the ones that they have seen.
	Technologies:	HTML CSS,Machine Learning,Javascript, Python, Flask.

## Research Experience
1. Time series analysis of rice production for SAARC countries: 
Built and trained the traditional machine learning models (Linear Regression, Parabolic Regression and Exponential Regression). 
Analyzed the past data to get the optimal Arima model to get the most accurate result for the data. Built the RNN model with keras and optimized and trained it to get the best result for our dataset.

2. Segmentation of different types of diseases in tomato plants :
Wrote the bridge that localized the segmentation of  the disease from the bounding box received after training and classifying using YOLO v5 algorithm.
wrote an algorithm(Region Growing Algorithm) that extracts the exact pixels of the leaf containing the disease and compares the region growing algorithm with the open cv version of grabcut algorithm.
